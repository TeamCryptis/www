Nested and mixed lists are an interesting beast. It's a corner case to make sure that lists within lists do not break the ordered list numbering order and list styles go deep enough.

## Ordered -- Unordered -- Ordered

1. ordered item
2. ordered item
  * **unordered**
  * **unordered**
    1. ordered item
    2. ordered item
3. ordered item
4. ordered item
